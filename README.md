## 🚧 Exciting New Projects Coming Soon! 🚧 ##
### 🛠️ My Work In Consulting ###
Since 2021, I've worked as a Software Engineer and Consultant at two different consulting firms. At both companies, I have collaborated directly with clients to build and ship 0→1 products — handling discovery, design, implementation, and production support — often in teams of 2–4 engineers on fast-paced timelines. I have shipped polished, documented, scalable betas in as little as 8 weeks, and shipped new features to production in under 4 hours. Projects typically span 2–4 months, and tech stacks can vary widely between products, although each company has its default tech stack when possible. In my current role, my focus has been React/Typescript frontends and AWS serverless (Python lambda) backends, with an emphasis on AI-integrated webapps. At my past company, I focused on API microservices, Django and Java backends, and React/Typescript frontends. 

### 🔎 Where's The Code? ###
Ramping up for each new consulting project involves rapidly upskilling on new tools and technologies to match the needs of the project. It is easy enough, especially in the ChatGPT era, to learn enough about a new technology to shoehorn it into an app to solve a particular problem. But truly understanding a technology, tool, or framework — how is it intended to be used? Where does it shine? What other tools does it play well with, and which use cases might create antipatterns and tech debt? Is it really the right choice for this project? ...that takes starting where the technology's creators intended. To gain this understanding, I've built dozens of proof-of-concepts and toy apps to better understand the technology. 

However, since these apps often mirror client architectures and use cases (even when built off-hours), they live in private enterprise repos. That’s why you won’t see much recent activity here—until now.

### 🔜 What's Coming ###
As I pursue my next opportunity, I’m refactoring the best of those internal toy apps into fresh, original projects here — built around new use cases I can share publicly. I'm also collaborating with a peer transitioning into project management, using this work as a firsthand opportunity for them to drive the project lifecycle. We're following miniaturized versions of real product workflows: requirements, backlogs, sprints, demos.

**Our goal: ship at least one stable beta per month.**\
**My focus:** flexing those product muscles. I want to explore new technologes, but I also want to build things I'll actually use.\
**My project manager's focus:** flexing those project muscles. Roadmaps, timelines, and the ability to keep the project on track if I go down a rabbit hole.\
**Our angle:** learning, experimenting, and getting in our 10,000 hours. This exercise is about play, not perfection; I want to showcase thoughtful product-engineering more than flawless codebases.

#### A few projects we're considering ####
- A mobile app that uses geolocation and AI to determine which credit card to use at a store to maximize rewards points
- An ADHD productivity tool that uses AI to organize reminders, based on the user's texts to themself
- A ChatGPT-backed document editor with realtime collaboration features
- Fanduel, but with your friends: an app that allows groups to "bet" (can be gamified points or real money) amongst their friends on their weekend golf outing, bowling night, etc and easily track progress during the event
- A webapp that creates softball season schedules, factoring in special situations and team requests
- A "UI cheat sheet": an intuitive playground of frontend components that demonstrates their use and lets the user quickly experiment with them. Inspiration: Material UI has many of these, like their [anchor playground](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-popover/#anchor-playground), but there are more that would be useful
- A deep dive into the [Tanstack](https://tanstack.com/) ecosystem

### 📅 Stay tuned! ###
Our first release is scheduled for April 30, 2025. Check back soon!

### Let's Chat ###
This entire process is inteded to be educational and collaborative. At times, the field of software enginering can feel daunting and unempathetic, but it doesn't have to be. This is a space for playfulness, curiosity, and conversation without judgement. See an area for improvement? Have an idea? Want to join in on the fun? I'd love to talk — reach out!

## About Me ##

👋  &nbsp; Hi, I’m @LaurelGerman\
💼  &nbsp; I have 4+ years' experience as a full stack SWE, after 5 years in IT Management\
🏆  &nbsp; You can find my work in the Coachella preregistration app, in a UC course site, and on the mobile device of a long-haul trucker\
💪  &nbsp; My strongest stack: React + Typescript frontend, AWS serverless backend (close second: Django)\
🌱  &nbsp; I rotate tech stacks often—consulting keeps me sharp and always learning\
🫶  &nbsp; I approach every project from a user-first perspective, and I love working at the intersection of product and engineering. I believe technology is a means to accomplish our goals; it's not the goal itself!\
🚀  &nbsp; Currently seeking my next opportunity to build meaningful, intuitive products alongside great humans\
